1. Pull and push to github:
You now have push access to the repository.

a. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/adi-s-bit/voter.git
   cd voter

b. Make sure you are on the correct branch:
   git checkout main

c. Pull the latest changes before editing:
   git pull origin main

d. Make your changes, then commit and push:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   git push origin main

2. For setting up RabbitMQ:
Install Docker Desktop if you don’t have it.
Open PowerShell and run:
docker run -d --hostname rabbitmq --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
This starts RabbitMQ and its management UI at http://localhost:15672 (default user: guest, password: guest).
